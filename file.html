        <p class="description">
          With a background in computer science and professional poker, I have
          developed a unique set of skills that enable me to excel in sales. I
          have a bachelor's degree from National Research University of
          Electronic Technology (MIET), where I learned the fundamentals of
          programming, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. I
          also have a certification in technical sales issued by LinkedIn, where
          I gained insights into the role of the sales engineer and the best
          practices for selling complex solutions. For four months, I worked as
          a salesperson at DREAM SPORT, a leading company in the sports
          equipment industry. I interacted productively with customers,
          providing them with timely and effective assistance, and building
          strong rapport. I also handled various types of operations for the
          transfer of goods, using customer-oriented software and computer
          programs with ease and efficiency. I contributed to increasing the
          sales volume and customer satisfaction by applying my entrepreneurial
          and analytical skills, which I honed as a professional poker player at
          PokerStars for over three years. There, I researched the tendencies of
          players and used specialized tools for statistical analysis, while
          also adapting to different situations, managing risks, and coping with
          stress. I am a fast learner, a multitasker, and a goal-oriented
          person, who strives to achieve excellence in everything I do. I am
          always eager to explore new areas, emphasize the most important
          information, and find the application of that knowledge in real-life
          situations. I am looking for a challenging and rewarding opportunity
          that will allow me to leverage my skills, experience, and education,
          and to grow professionally and personally.
